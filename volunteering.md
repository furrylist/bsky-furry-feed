# Volunteering

I'd like to keep working on Furry Feed but unfortunately, I'm very much
time-constrained. With that in mind, I'm looking for a few furs who want to
help out so I can focus on keeping the feed running and adding features.

In both cases, I'm looking for individuals who are happy working with a large
amount of ownership over their own work.

Please get in touch on Discord (`ottr.sh`) or Telegram (`@strideynet`) if you
are interested.

## Trust and Safety Lead

I have great intentions for making the Furry Feed a safe space, but this isn't a
an area I have a tonne of experience in. As such, I need some help.

Responsibilities:

- Writing TnS communications: There's a draft of the Community Guidelines but I
  need someone to take ownership of this and get it finished to the point where
  we can publish it.
- Writing TnS policy
- Deciding when we need additional TnS volunteers and who we select

## Frontend Engineer

I'm looking for someone who is confident enough to build a frontend to interact
with my API in order to create a moderation panel and other sites as we need
them.

I'm not fussy about the techs involved, but React or Vue are things I'm familiar
with and provide me more ability to review and help out where I can.
