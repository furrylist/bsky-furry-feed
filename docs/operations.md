# Operations

## Deploying

For now, weâ€™re back to manual deployments:

1. Create a release on GitHub with a new tag.
1. Wait for docker image build to succeed.
1. If migration is necessary, execute it manually via `psql` and bump up the version in the `schema_migrations` table, until we have better tooling.
1. Update the version tag in the [infra repo][infrarepo].
1. On the server, update the `furrylist-infra` repo and run `docker compose up -d`.
1. Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰
1. If feeds were changed or added since the last deployment, run the **Deploy Feeds** CI job.
